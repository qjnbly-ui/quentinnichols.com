        <p class="about-body">Growing up in the close-knit community of Bly, Oregon, I developed a deep, lifelong connection to my hometown. My passion for writing, photography, and videography was sparked by a desire to capture and preserve meaningful moments.</p>
        <p class="about-body">From restoring a local gym to working abroad in New Zealand, and serving my community as a firefighter, each of these moments has taught me invaluable lessons about resilience and compassion. Each experience, and every person who has been a part of my journey, has equally contributed to who I am today.</p>

            <p class="about-item-org">Brightview Dairy — New Zealand</p>
            <p class="about-item-dates">Sep 2019 – Mar 2020</p>
            <p class="about-item-body">My mom hosted a foreign exchange student, Nicole, who came from New Zealand, and her family came to visit us before she returned home. Her dad briefly mentioned there might be an opportunity for me to come over and work for them. They owned Brightview Dairy.</p>
            <p class="about-item-body">Two years later, I reached out to Nicole and asked if that opportunity was still an option. It was. Within a month, I got my things together and went to New Zealand, where I lived and worked until March 2020.</p>
            <p class="about-item-body">As COVID began to emerge globally, I made the decision to return to the United States, unsure whether waiting longer would leave me unable to get home.</p>
            <p class="about-item-body">When I landed in Reno, Nevada, I got off the plane and went to get into an Uber, assuming life continued on the same way it had in New Zealand. I attempted to hop into the passenger seat so I could have a conversation with the driver, but before I even got in, he took me aside. He handed me a mask, squirted hand sanitizer into my hand, and told me I needed to sit in the back seat.</p>
            <p class="about-item-body">It was a shock. In New Zealand, masks weren’t being worn and it didn’t feel like a major concern. I was also expecting my family and I would go out to eat dinner that night, and that wasn’t an option either. It was a complete shift, and suddenly I was back home with no clear plan.</p>

Doing the same task daily drained the excitement I had experienced elsewhere, but I finished the apprenticeship early and got my journeyman card.</p>

            <p class="about-item-dates">Apr 2025 – Present</p>
            <p class="about-item-body">I returned to work and currently serve as a foreman. As strange as it may seem, August 2025 is when I finally started to feel like myself again. I slowly boxed up Homer’s belongings, completed long-overdue projects, and made the house feel like mine. It was a slow and depressing process, and I truly feel bad for the people I worked with or interacted with during that time. It just wasn’t me.</p>
            <p class="about-item-body">Now, I feel closer to my teenage energy and dreams again, but with new grounding, like owning a home and understanding responsibility differently. I’m excited for each day ahead. I’m not trying to escape anything anymore.</p>

            <p class="about-item-role">Closing Reflection</p>
            <p class="about-item-body">As I write this, it feels like a constant back and forth — depending on Trees, but always wanting to get away from it. That tension is where a lot of my excitement for the future comes from. I don’t want to work for Trees forever, but I also need to figure out how to value it, because it’s the thing that has held my life together over this five-year period.</p>
            <p class="about-item-body">I don’t really know what that means yet. Was I a good employee, a bad employee, someone with unorganized ambition, or something else entirely? I’m not sure. What I do know is that I feel like I’m finally getting my life on track, and I’m genuinely excited for what’s ahead.</p>
            <p class="about-item-body">That’s where a website like this helps — it gives me a place to share my story, reflect on it honestly, and build forward from here. Hopefully, everything above represents the struggle of trying to find myself.</p>
            <p class="about-item-body">I have friends who worked extremely hard to pay off their houses financially. Maybe I’ve done something similar, but through practical life experience instead. I don’t know yet. We’ll see what happens.</p>

            <p class="about-item-role">A Reminder from an Earlier Season</p>
            <p class="about-quote">“We are born with the gift of not knowing, to delight in learning life’s simple joys. Our bodies bear the price of adventure, and sleep, our return to essence.”</p>
            <p class="about-quote-signature">— Quentin Nichols</p>
            <p class="about-item-body">That line emerged during a period when my writing — and my website as a whole — was shaped by grief, reflection, and a deep engagement with philosophy, faith, and the nature of existence. At the time, I wrote openly and vulnerably because I was actively processing loss, meaning, and responsibility in real time. Looking back, that philosophy hasn’t disappeared; it has simply been absorbed. What once needed expression has become part of my internal framework, now carried quietly within the broader arc of my life story rather than spoken outright.</p>
