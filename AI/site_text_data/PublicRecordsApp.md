Make public records easy to find

Search, preview, and download records in seconds. Built to keep recurring documents accessible.

Preview a live public records site and return here anytime.

Why I built it

I built this to solve a real problem for our Community Action Team: making minutes easy for the public to access while giving board members fast context from past meetings.

It is live on blyoregon.com (see the public example above), and after sharing it, another board member asked about using the same approach for their organization. This page is the productized version of that solution.

Instant Search

Keyword search across every record, with fast filtering by year.

Preview & Download

Open records in a built-in viewer or download the source file.

Simple Publishing

Add new records without rebuilding the site. Keep archives organized.

Branded for You

Custom colors, logos, and labels for each organization.
