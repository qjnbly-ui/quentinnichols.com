Each morning during our YWAM trip in San Francisco, a small group of us would get up around 5:30 AM and head
          to Starbucks for coffee before our usual 8:00 AM start time. On this particular morning, our leader, Willem,
          opened the door for us to leave the base. We encountered a homeless man sleeping right in front of the door.
          Carefully, we nudged him aside so we could head out to get our coffee.

After spending some time at Starbucks, we returned to find the homeless man still sleeping in front of the
          door. A man in a wheelchair nearby saw us struggling and called out, "Come on, let these nice white folks in!"
          When the sleeping man didn't respond, the man in the wheelchair lost patience. He wheeled back, took a hit
          from his crack pipe, then stood up and started wailing on the sleeping man with his cane. The homeless man
          jolted awake, hopped out of his sleeping bag completely naked, and started running away, holding the sleeping
          bag in front of him to fend off the blows.

As the commotion unfolded, we quickly slipped inside to sit and enjoy our coffee, and some sat down for their
          Bible study. While some ignored the situation, I turned my chair to face the glass windows, laughing and
          watching the scene unfold with Willem occasionally glancing at me, distracted by my determination to
          continue watching. Cars were honking, and the man in the wheelchair kept returning to his wheelchair to take
          another hit from his crack pipe before resuming the chase, seemingly determined to keep the naked man away
          from the door.

By the time everyone else got up and came upstairs, we had quite the story to share, while they were just
          waking up to a typical morning.
