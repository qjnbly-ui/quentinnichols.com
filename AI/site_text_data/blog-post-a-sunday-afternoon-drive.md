Sunday afternoon, the fresh snow at the top of Gearhart Mountain just looked incredible. So I took a drive
          with the dogs up my favorite road. It’s such a nice road because you slowly come up and around a corner and
          then there’s this reveal of the summit. It’s breathtaking. Words don’t even match what you feel.

I got up there and decided to take a drone video. It wasn’t something I planned to share, but when I got home
          and watched it, I thought, “This is too good not to show.”

I took a couple pictures of the dogs, but on the way out, I got Leo to jump onto a log — one that had broken
          off from its stump long ago. I snapped a photo and it too became an instant favorite.
