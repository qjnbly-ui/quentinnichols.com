When I was a kid, I used to try climbing the big pine tree at my great grandparents’ place, the one they
          planted when my Aunt Terri was about six or seven.

My great grandpa Bill had old Weyerhaeuser logging videos, and I used to watch the men in those films climb
          with ropes and spikes. I’d try to do the same thing with a set of heavy chains, flipping them around the
          trunk and trying to walk up. I never got far.

These days, I do tree work professionally. This was the first time I made it to the top of that pine tree.
          I brought my little sister Teagan’s old tricycle with me, one she outgrew. I’ve had it sitting around for a
          year or more, waiting for the moment I decided to finally take it up.

The idea came from something I did a while back when I was trimming the willow tree at my house. I found an
          old tricycle there that belonged to one of Homer’s kids and decided to hang it from one of the limbs, just to
          be funny and make people wonder how it got there.

So this time, I did the same. I climbed that old pine from my childhood and finally made it to the top.
          Teagan’s tricycle now sits near the top, where it can see everything below.
