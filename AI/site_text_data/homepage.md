Hey, I’m Quentin

I’m drawn to the small details of life — the landscapes, the stories that came before us, and the creative work happening today. I’m trying to make more room for the things I love, and this site is where I track the projects, photos, and ideas that come out of that.

About

Rooted in rural Oregon, and shaped by life experience.

My path has moved through line clearance tree trimming, EMT and firefighter training, caregiving, and long stretches of community work — all of it feeding the way I see and document the world.

If you want the full timeline and context, it’s on the About page.

Photography

Ongoing bodies of work, portraits, and documentary projects from the places and people I know.

Blog

Longer reflections, field notes, and the stories behind what I’m making and learning.

Community Projects

Local initiatives that keep small-town institutions visible and useful.
