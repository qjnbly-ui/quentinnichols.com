This morning at 8 AM, I left my home in Bly, Oregon, marking the beginning of a journey I have been
          anticipating for what feels like forever. The last two days were a whirlwind of packing, making sure I had
          everything I needed, and now, with the car loaded and my gear ready, I feel the excitement building as I
          finally hit the road.

My first stop will be in the desert, where I plan to ride the Onewheel for a bit to let the dogs run. By
          tonight, I hope to reach Lyman, Wyoming. There are a few sights around there that I have been eager to check
          out, but the real adventure begins when I arrive in Hutchinson, Kansas, where my good friend Robert lives.

Robert and I have been talking about traveling together for years, and now it is finally happening. Our
          first big destination together is Memphis, where we will visit Graceland, a place we have both wanted to see
          for as long as I can remember. From there, we will make our way through St. Louis and Nashville, soaking in
          the history and music, before heading to the Biltmore Estate, which is another spot we are both really
          excited about.

After Memphis, I will spend a few days in Hutchinson with Robert, helping him trim some trees, I brought my
          saw and climbing gear just for this.

Before I left Bly, two amazing friends, Sara and Elizabeth from our volunteer fire department, went through
          Homer’s house with me, helping pack up pictures and personal items that belonged to him. These things hold so
          many memories, and I am honored to be taking them to Homer’s niece, Sandi, who lives just south of Dallas,
          Texas. Homer spoke of her often, and she’s been a wonderful person to connect with. I am really looking
          forward to meeting her in person, sharing stories, and watching old home movies together for the first time.
          I even brought a projector.

From there, I have lots of plans and places to see, and with God willing, that is exactly what I intend to
          do. This journey is a chance to connect with the past, live fully in the present, and move toward the
          future. I am excited to see where the road leads me.
