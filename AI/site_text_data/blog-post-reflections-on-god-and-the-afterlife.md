My Reflection on Jeffrey Long’s Book: God and the Afterlife

Jeffrey Long’s book has profoundly shaped my understanding of God and the afterlife. I had always sought a
          deeper connection to God but didn’t know how to reach it. Reading this book opened my eyes to a new way of
          seeing life beyond death. It didn’t just change my perspective—it changed my life.

I don’t adhere to a traditional view of God tied to any single religion. Instead, I see God as an
          all-knowing, all-loving presence connected to all that is good. I believe we are all linked, and every act of
          kindness brings God into the physical world. It doesn’t matter what tradition or faith one follows—anyone
          who does good is manifesting God’s presence on Earth and shaping their place in the afterlife.

What God and the Afterlife Is About

Jeffrey Long, a doctor and researcher, has studied thousands of near-death experiences (NDEs). In this book,
          he shares accounts from people who were clinically dead and revived. The consistency across these stories is
          striking—people describe leaving their bodies, viewing the world from above, and feeling the presence of a
          loving, all-knowing being, often identified as God.

A recurring theme is the experience of being surrounded by a radiant, loving light—brighter than anything
          imaginable, yet not blinding or painful. Many describe this light as God’s presence, radiating pure love and
          understanding. Some recount encounters with angels or loved ones who had passed on, providing them with a
          deep sense of comfort.

Another profound aspect of these experiences is the life review, where individuals relive moments from their
          lives, seeing the impact of their actions on others. This review is not a judgmental process in the
          traditional sense, but rather one of deep understanding. People report that they must feel the emotions, both
          good and bad, that they caused others. If they hurt someone, they experience that pain from the other
          person’s perspective. For most, this experience carries a sense of purpose, encouraging them to return to
          life with a renewed commitment to living more purely and with greater compassion.

Many report nearing a boundary that separates life and death, only to be sent back because their time on
          Earth wasn’t complete. Above all, the overwhelming sensation reported is one of peace and love—something more
          profound than anything they had ever known in life.

Long’s research demonstrates that these experiences transcend religion and culture. His central message is
          clear: death is not the end but a transition into something far greater. This book offers comfort to those
          who fear the unknown and provides compelling evidence that consciousness continues beyond death.

My Personal Takeaway

What struck me most about God and the Afterlife is how it affirmed something I’ve always felt deep down—God
          is not confined to one religion or set of rituals. The stories in this book reinforced my belief that God is
          present in everything good, and His presence is brought to life through our actions. This revelation has
          profoundly impacted my role as an EMT.

One particular story in the book changed how I perceive death. A man recounted witnessing angels taking his
          wife after a car accident. This helped me realize that when someone passes, they are not simply gone—they are
          returning home, embraced by love and peace. This understanding has completely transformed how I approach
          death, both personally and professionally. I now see it as one of the most peaceful experiences a person can
          have, and it brings me comfort knowing that those I help in their final moments are stepping into that love
          and peace.

Reading about NDEs also made me reflect on my own life. Many people described meeting angels or loved ones and
          undergoing a life review, where they saw the ripple effects of their actions. This made me think deeply about
          how I live and how my choices impact others.

A New Perspective on Life

This book didn’t just change my thoughts on death—it changed how I live. Now, whenever I face struggles, I
          remind myself of the bigger picture and the presence of God in everything. This shift has allowed me to live
          with more love and purpose, knowing that every action has meaning.

I hope to be a source of comfort for those struggling in this world. We are all connected, and everything we
          experience carries significance. Understanding that death is not an end but a transition into something more
          beautiful helps me focus on living fully and embracing each moment with love.
