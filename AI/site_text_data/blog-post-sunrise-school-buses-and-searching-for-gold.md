# Sunrise, School Buses, and Searching for Gold

It started with a drive. I had the day off but woke up early anyway. I really enjoy my morning drives — there’s
          nothing quite like going for a ride as the sun rises.

So I took the dogs and headed up the newly reconstructed road that goes up onto Gearhart Mountain. They tore
          the asphalt off and laid down new gravel. I drove past Campbell Reservoir and looped around through Obenchain
          and back. Just a simple route I take often. I had my camera with me and was taking pictures along the way. I
          listened to music for about half the drive.

Then I saw a culvert.

Something about it triggered a memory — my grandpa Bruce recently told me about a guy he knew who used to find
          gold while panning in culverts along the Oregon coast. He’d stop where the water slowed, and collect a bucket
          to later sift through the sediment. That little memory kicked off a flood of questions in my head.

I wondered: Could there be gold around places like Gearhart Mountain? It’s an ancient volcanic area, and I
          know water moves sediment from higher elevations. If gold was in the rock, maybe it could get trapped in the
          same way — like that guy panning roadside culverts.

So I asked ChatGPT.

And that’s where the real ride began.

First, we talked geology. The AI explained how gold doesn’t just show up randomly — it erodes from gold-bearing
          rock (often igneous or metamorphic) and is carried by water downstream. Over time, heavier materials like gold
          settle out when the water slows — in spots like inside bends of rivers, behind large rocks, in gravel bars, or
          yes — culverts.

Then came the mineral indicators. That’s when I learned about pyrite — fool’s gold — and how it often shows up
          in the same geological environments as real gold. Finding pyrite isn’t a guarantee of gold, but it’s a clue
          that the conditions are right. The AI mentioned other minerals too: magnetite, hematite, even quartz. I perked
          up at that.

“Quartz Mountain,” I said. “It’s named after quartz, right? Would that be a sign of something?”

Definitely, it told me. Quartz veins are classic signs of hydrothermal activity — and gold often forms in
          those same kinds of veins. If you’re seeing big chunks of white or milky quartz out in the wild, especially
          cutting through other rock, that’s something worth checking out.

I learned about how hydrothermal fluids — superheated, mineral-rich water — travel through cracks in Earth’s
          crust, leaving behind veins of quartz, pyrite, and sometimes gold as they cool. It was like discovering that
          the Earth had been brewing something for millions of years just below the surface.

The conversation didn’t stop there. I started getting curious about how we even talk about these things. I
          asked, “Is mineralogical the right word for this stuff?” And yes — it turns out, “mineralogical” is the
          adjective form of “mineralogy,” which is the study of minerals.

And here’s where it got even more interesting — we went off into a whole dive on language. I learned that the
          suffix “-ology” means “the study of,” and “-logical” means “related to the study of.” That kind of stuff
          always catches my interest. Honestly, I always thought it was spelled verbage — like with an A-G-E — but
          apparently the right word is verbiage, with an “I.” I’d been saying and spelling it wrong this whole time.

Then the AI mentioned the Greek root logos, and that stopped me in my tracks. I said, “Wait, is that the same
          logos that Viktor Frankl used in logotherapy?” It immediately took me back to last July, when I read Man’s
          Search for Meaning. That book really stuck with me, and hearing the word logos again made it all click —
          Frankl wasn’t just using a fancy term. He was tying it back to the Greek idea of reason, word, and meaning.

Frankl survived the Holocaust and came out of it with a deep conviction: that what keeps people alive — what
          gives life value — is meaning. Not pleasure, not power. Meaning. He built an entire form of therapy around
          this idea, and it’s based on that same root: logos.

And here we were — on a morning ride that started with gold in a ditch and ended up digging through the core
          of human purpose.

I loved how it all connected. From the rocks beneath my feet to the words we use to describe them. From the
          chance of finding flakes of gold in a culvert, to learning the roots of meaning in our language and
          psychology. I wasn’t just on a drive — I was on a ride through curiosity, discovery, and understanding.

By the time I made it back down the loop, I wasn’t just thinking about culverts anymore. I was thinking about
          how every little observation — even a roadside drain — can lead you into a deeper world, if you just stay
          curious.

I ended up returning from my drive and got home, and I was crafting this blog post in my pickup before I even
          hopped out, just wanting to get it all down while the memories were fresh. Then we got a medical call — just a
          patient having trouble breathing. The app that usually gives us more info wasn’t loading, so I ran down to my
          grandpa’s to see if his would work. From there, I made a decision on our response, hopped back in my pickup,
          and passed the school bus on the way to the fire station. Sometimes seconds count on these calls, and it was
          an appropriate spot to pass.

I got into the command vehicle, which is a fast response unit stocked with all of our medical supplies, and
          flipped on the lights and sirens. As I pulled out of the station, the school bus was there picking up some
          kids. They waited for me to pull out and get onto the highway.

I headed up Pinecrest Drive, picked up another volunteer firefighter, and on our way back down, we saw the
          bus again heading up. We continued on toward Beatty, still in full response mode, when we got the call to
          stand down. The patient’s family had decided to handle transport themselves.

On the way back, while I was taking the other volunteer home, we passed the school bus again going the
          opposite direction. After all that, no lights, no sirens, just driving along like nothing had happened. They
          probably wondered why I was in such a hurry just to be going the opposite direction with no purpose. It
          probably didn’t make much sense to them. It just made me laugh.

Now I’m here, wrapping up this post, thinking about how full this morning has been. There’s something
          important about just waking up, being mentally present, being available in your community, and being open to
          what the world has to show you. Whether it’s chasing gold, responding to a call, or just learning how to spell
          verbiage right, life is always offering something new if you’re ready for it.
