I want to start by mentioning that I got sick on Monday, November 11th. Following that day, I developed a
          fever of 103 degrees, which was difficult to overcome. I prayed, hoped, and did everything in my power to
          fight it off. During this time, I hardly ate and felt mentally weak, which was especially challenging since I
          believed God had just brought something very special into my life. This experience was hard to comprehend.

Sometimes, I can only turn to God because sickness is a reminder of our mortality, but I hold an undeniable
          faith that one day I will be with Him in all of His beauty. I don’t believe I have yet fulfilled what is
          planned for me. As I tried to make sense of the two significant things that entered my life this week, I
          found myself without clear answers. I wanted to understand why I became sick. Could it have been an
          intentional moment to reveal something greater? How is it that things which seem God-given and nearly perfect
          can appear too perfect for this world and then be taken away?

This experience gave me a slight understanding and a deeper sense of my faith. I recognized that the good
          possible in the world must be completely centered on faith and trust in God’s timing. Without that,
          everything I’ve worked towards would be lost. In reflecting on this, I realized that God works in each of us
          individually. I saw the beauty in watching life unfold, even though it often feels repetitive. Looking back,
          every life experience has led me to this moment.

In my childhood, I was surrounded by deep questions, touches of pain, a sense of being lost or heldback at
          times, and even actions that strayed from God’s plan for me. I didn’t understand it then, but I do now. I
          hope others can see how important those lessons and transformations are, as God’s work in us can be so pure.
          For example, when Homer’s son Michael became sick, I couldn’t understand why more pain was entering my life. I
          wanted everything to be healed and normal, but the experience built my character and made me stronger. I’m in
          one of those moments again—questioning God, feeling shame, and seeking answers that I know will come in time.
          These experiences always find purpose.

Why am I sometimes blind to this? Perhaps this sickness was meant to weaken my mind, to reveal how fragile my
          faith can be and to serve as a hidden building block. In my desperation, I turned to the accounts of others
          who have written beautifully about their experiences, transcending time through one organized book. I found
          the connections and confirmations I needed.

Despite my worsening sickness, I felt desperate for more understanding and wanted prayer. I mustered the
          strength to attend church. Standing during worship was hard—my vision blurred, and I was sweating—but I made
          it through. The pastor’s prayer was exactly what I knew God would provide; it reassured me. His message
          reminded me to be wary of the inner voice that may not always be from God and to seek guidance from the Bible.
          While I strongly feel I know God’s voice, there are times when He seems absent, and I must find my way back.
          This week has tested my faith but also deepened it.

His prayer was deeply significant and pure, envisioning potential within me and reinforcing God’s work in my
          life. I admire him greatly for his faith and dedication, and his ability to pray with such heartfelt
          conviction moves me.

In summary, I am 23 years old—a young age in the image of eternity. I hope we can all show love and respect
          for one another’s journeys, recognizing their unique paths, directions, and timings. At some point during this
          experience, I caught a fresh glimpse of God’s potential, and it changed my life. Before this, I felt like a
          pitiful existence by my own estimation. I worry about how others perceive this moment versus how I see it, but
          I would never change any of it, as every single experience led me here.

I am thankful for all of it and feel compelled to share my journey to connect with those around me, to provide
          hope for a better life. I want this not only for myself but for everyone. This is why I write these things—
          they may be controversial, not fully developed, or even wrong, but documenting my journey is important because
          each day is its own complex creation. I hope to openly share my growth and encourage others to embrace who
          they are, who they have been, and who they are becoming.

I also want to emphasize that I firmly believe God is the all-knowing Creator behind everything. I don’t place
          my faith in man or any definitive set of beliefs. Instead, I see us all as equals, striving to understand what
          God is doing in and through us. While our experiences are valuable and can be shared, they are ultimately
          unique to each of us. Let us build each other up, without pretending to know where God is leading anyone else.
          The Bible was written by men inspired by God, but He continues to speak to us today in ways that remain deeply
          relevant. I rely on the Bible because of its consistent message across many lives touched by God, similar to
          the guidance I seek and follow by confirming that others have also heard His voice.
