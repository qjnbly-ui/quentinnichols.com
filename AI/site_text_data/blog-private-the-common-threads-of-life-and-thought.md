I don’t think any differently than anyone else—for the most part, we’re all born with the same basic framework of
          thought, shaped by unique interests, environments, and experiences. Some exceptions aside, our shared mental
          construction develops in countless directions, making us more alike than we sometimes realize. This realization
          has been at the core of my reflections lately, especially as I navigate what to focus on in my writing.

I’ve often wondered what should and shouldn’t be written about, which thoughts are worth saving, and how much of
          myself I should share. I tend to jump from one thought to another, but I’ve realized that in embracing this flow,
          I can capture something universal. We all experience these fluctuations, shaped by our environment, habits, and
          health. So, I’ve decided to write about my experiences as they happen, reflecting on what feels meaningful and
          worth holding onto.

This morning, I woke up to a house that was colder than usual. One of my heaters isn’t working properly, and it
          immediately transported me back to a time a little over a year ago. I was living in an old quonset hut building
          at the gym I manage. The fire in the stove wouldn’t always last through the night, and I often woke up to a
          frigid room. My mornings then were a routine of lighting a propane heater in the gym’s locker room, taking a
          still-cold shower, and hopping out in shorts for a days training at the KCC fire academy. Then preparing Homer for
          his day, before I’d moved in with him.

Those memories shaped my mood this morning until I changed it—putting on Willie’s Roadhouse on Sirius XM,
          drinking a few cups of coffee, and heading upstairs to play guitar. I even posted a video of myself singing, not
          for perfection but for a laugh, to lock into a good mood for the start of my Monday.

It reminded me how much music and environment influence my state of mind, especially in the mornings. I’m most
          sensitive to music at this time of day. Whether it’s a party song tied to a memory or a calming tune that sets
          the tone, mornings feel like a reset—a space where I can intentionally choose my mood and carry it forward.

This sensitivity and the ability to reflect deeply in the mornings brought me to another thought: the connection
          between our physical habits and mental states. I had no breakfast today, and I felt my mood shift as I became more
          aware of how I need to focus on taking better care of my health. It’s a lesson I’m learning again and again.

The other day, I came across Lisa Marie Presley’s book, written and completed by her daughter, Riley Keough. I
          was already reading three or four other books focused on knowledge and comprehension, but this one felt
          different—a life story meant to be listened to, absorbed, and reflected upon. I finished it within days. There’s
          something profoundly unifying in reading someone else’s words. You hear their thoughts in your own voice,
          bridging the gap between their life and your own.

Before bed last night, I watched a few videos from Soft White Underbelly and felt the same connection. These
          stories, along with Lisa’s and my own experiences, highlighted how capable we all are of being either lost or
          well. Life affects us all, and it’s through these shared stories that we remember we’re not alone in navigating
          it.

This brings me back to my writing. I don’t have a clear direction yet, but I know this: life is full of moments
          worth sharing, even if they’re imperfect or fleeting. Whether it’s finding rhythm in music for the first time,
          reflecting on a book, or simply trying to take better care of yourself, there’s value in documenting these
          things—not just for yourself but for others who may find meaning in them.

I want to follow this instinct, to help others in any way I can by sharing my experiences, thoughts, and the
          lessons I’ve learned. I am making my journal available to everyone in some way. I don’t know where this path will
          lead, but I know it’s worth pursuing.

After all, no matter who we are or what our experiences have been, we’re all here to do the same thing: live,
          connect, and share what we’ve learned along the way.
