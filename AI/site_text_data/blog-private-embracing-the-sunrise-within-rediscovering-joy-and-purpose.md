As I watched the sunrise this morning, the sky transformed into a canvas of purple, red, and blue. I was
          reminded of the incredible opportunity each day brings—a chance to start anew, to seek adventure, and to
          find knowledge in the world around us.

As children, we embrace the world with wonder because our needs are taken care of, allowing us the freedom to
          explore. But as we grow older, responsibilities pile up, and we often forget the simple joy of being present
          in the moment.

Caring for Homer brought structure and purpose to my life, yet I found myself longing for the freedom to
          rediscover my passions. Now, as I navigate life with a newfound appreciation for the present, I see how God
          has filled my life with opportunities for growth, creativity, and connection.

Through meditation, I've discovered the importance of tuning into a higher form of guidance. In the quiet
          moments of clearing my mind, I connect with a divine will, receiving thoughts that align with my true
          purpose. It's as if the universe gently nudges me toward the good, helping me discern which thoughts and
          actions are in harmony with my highest self. I believe we all call this prayer.

As the sun climbs higher, illuminating the world in a golden glow, I see a reflection of my own journey. By
          embracing the present and seeking deeper connections, I've unlocked creativity, hope, and an abundance of
          joy. Life is filled with purpose when we allow ourselves the freedom to follow the path laid out for us,
          trusting in the divine timing of the universe.

Today, I encourage you to take a moment, amidst the beauty of a sunrise or the calm of a quiet evening, to
          clear your mind and listen. Remember that the wonder and joy of childhood still exist within us, waiting to
          be rediscovered, now enriched with the wisdom we’ve gained along the way.

I took a moment to stop by Homer and Michael's graves before heading to work, following writing this post. It was a special, meaningful moment.
