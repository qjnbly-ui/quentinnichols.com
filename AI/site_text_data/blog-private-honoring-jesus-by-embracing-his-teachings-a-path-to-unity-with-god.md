Quentin Nichols·Reading of Blog Post From 12.18.24

As I’ve come to understand Jesus more, I’ve started to think about how His life must have felt. He lived with a
        level of divine understanding and connection that most people couldn’t grasp, and I imagine that, over time,
        this set Him apart in a profound way. Not because He wanted to separate Himself, but because He had to live and
        preach in a way that aligned fully with the divine nature He embodied. He wasn’t just teaching people how to
        live; He was showing them what it meant to be in complete unity with God, something most of us only glimpse in
        moments of clarity.

In John 17:21, Jesus prays, “That all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they
        also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.” This prayer reveals His deepest desire: for
        others to experience the same unity with God that He did. It wasn’t about elevating Himself but about bringing
        others to that same place of divine connection. I think Jesus must have felt a profound sense of longing for
        people to truly understand what He was living and teaching. He wasn’t trying to set Himself apart—He wanted to
        bridge the gap between humanity and God. But because He lived in full alignment with God’s will, He naturally
        stood out, even among His closest followers.

That’s why John 14:12 stands out so much to me: “Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I
        have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I have been doing, and they will do even 
        greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.” This verse
        reminds me that Jesus never intended to make Himself an object of worship. Instead, He wanted us to trust His
        judgment, to believe in the life He lived and the teachings He shared. He wasn’t saying, “You must worship me.”
        He was saying, “Follow this path, and you can go even further.” To me, this shows the depth of His faith in
        humanity and the divine potential within each of us.

But I’ve struggled to connect with Jesus in the way others often do. I have a deep connection to a divine nature
        that I call God, but I don’t feel the need to idolize or worship Jesus as though He’s separate from the rest of
        us. What I struggle with is how people seem to place all their focus on Jesus Himself rather than on the life He
        lived and the message He preached. Jesus wasn’t trying to turn attention toward Himself—He was pointing us
        toward God. His teachings are what we should worship, because they’re what lead us to divine understanding.

That’s not to say Jesus isn’t worthy of praise—He absolutely is. The life He lived, the truth He embodied, and
        the way He carried out His mission are incredible and inspiring. But the focus shouldn’t be on worshiping Him
        as separate or unreachable. Instead, we should strive to embody the teachings He gave us, the way He showed us
        to live in unity with God. Through that, He becomes worthy of praise—not because we idolize Him, but because we
        honor the example He set.

For so long, I felt disconnected from the idea of Jesus because I couldn’t relate to the way others spoke about
        Him. But as I’ve come to see Him as a teacher, a guide, and a model of what it means to fully embrace divine
        will, I’ve grown to appreciate Him more deeply. I don’t see Him as separate or above us—I see Him as someone
        who showed us what’s possible when we trust in God completely. His life isn’t meant to be idolized; it’s meant
        to be lived. And through living it, we honor Him in the way I believe He truly intended.

My Spiritual Identity

My spiritual journey is one of exploration, growth, and evolving understanding. Rooted in a deep connection
        with divine nature—what I call God—I see spirituality as a personal and ongoing process of aligning with truth,
        love, and higher purpose. While I draw heavily from the teachings of Jesus, my beliefs are not confined to
        rigid doctrines but embrace universal principles of compassion, mindfulness, and personal transformation.

Jesus as a Teacher and Guide

I view Jesus as a profound teacher and guide, someone who lived in full alignment with divine will and showed
        us the way to connect with God. His teachings on love, humility, and unity resonate deeply with me. I believe
        in honoring His example by embodying the values He taught, rather than idolizing Him. For me, Jesus’s life is
        an invitation to explore our own divine potential and connection with God.

Focus on Direct Connection with God

At the heart of my spirituality is a direct relationship with God. I believe that prayer and meditation are
        powerful tools for connecting with divine wisdom. My approach emphasizes stillness and listening, creating
        space for God to speak to the deepest parts of our being. This connection is not about fear or obligation but
        about love, trust, and alignment with divine truth.

Exploration of Universal Truths

My journey also draws from universal spiritual philosophies that emphasize personal growth and inner
        transformation:

Like Judaism, I value living righteously and maintaining a direct connection with God.

From Hinduism and Buddhism, I resonate with the importance of mindfulness, meditation, and aligning with
          divine truth.

Inspired by Taoism, I seek harmony with the natural flow of life, aligning my actions with the greater whole.

Rejecting Fear-Based Approaches

I believe faith should be rooted in love, not fear. Fear-based preaching often distorts the message of grace
        and connection, replacing God’s invitation with guilt and anxiety. Instead, I focus on the transformative
        power of love, hope, and the freedom to grow in understanding.

A Journey of Spiritual Evolution

Spirituality, for me, is not about arriving at definitive answers but about continuing to seek, question, and
        grow. I acknowledge that my beliefs are not fixed—they evolve as I gain new insights and experiences. This
        openness allows me to honor the teachings of the past while embracing the unfolding of my own spiritual path.

What This Means for My Journey

My spiritual philosophy is about striving to live in harmony with divine nature, guided by love, compassion,
        and truth. It’s about creating space for growth and understanding, both for myself and others. While I honor
        the wisdom of many traditions, my focus remains on fostering a direct connection with God and embodying the
        values that bring us closer to divine unity.
