Traveling across the United States has been an incredible journey. So far, I’ve passed through 19 states,
          taking in countless sights and creating memories at every stop, ready to revisit through thought. Along the
          way, I’ve developed new perspectives and noticed many changes within myself—both in my character and in my
          appearance. I’ve immersed myself in podcasts, books, sermons, music, and more, and I feel more inspired on this
          trip than I have in many years combined.

I’ve embraced the highs and lows, knowing that everything happens for a greater purpose. There were
          challenges I didn’t anticipate, some caused by disappointments or environmental factors beyond my control.
          Yet, I pressed on, sensing that there was something deeper to discover. Initially, I thought the iconic
          sights were my primary goal. But as I reflect on the journey, I realize that while I now have personal
          memories tied to these places, the sights themselves didn’t differ much from what I’d already seen in books,
          movies, or videos.

The real transformation happened in the mountains of North Carolina, along the Blue Ridge Parkway. There, I
          met so many people who shared goals similar to mine: to slow down and truly appreciate the beauty of the
          world around us. I experienced a few life-altering moments, realizing that even the smallest shift in thought
          can bring about dramatic changes, for better or worse. Leaving those mountains, I felt I had truly changed,
          though I didn’t fully recognize it until reflecting just now.

I’ve come to understand that traveling isn’t about checking off famous landmarks—it’s about connecting with
          people and fully embracing the land where I find myself. For much of the journey, I struggled to relax and
          fully enjoy any one spot because I was always focused on the next destination. This mindset goes against
          something I recently read: to avoid talking about the future as if it’s certain and instead be thankful for
          the present moment.

After the mountains, I tried to get in touch with Robert, who was caring for my dogs back in Kansas. I hadn’t
          heard from him in a few days, and when I still couldn’t reach him, I decided to cut my planned route through
          Virginia and the Northeast short and head back to Kansas. I had intended to reach Niagara Falls within 10–11
          days and then spend another week or two traveling. But after 29 days on the road, I can’t express how tired I
          am. The excitement of seeing my dogs was overwhelming, and now I’m unsure how much more traveling I’ll do.

I’m eager to be home, where I can focus on the projects waiting for me and return to a structured routine.
          There’s something comforting about the idea of being home. A man I met in the mountains shared an old saying
          with me: “Rivers are rivers, and mountains are mountains.” It’s a simple phrase, but there’s so much wisdom
          in it.

Reflecting further, I realize that no matter where you are in the country, people are living their own lives
          at home, just as I do back home. Initially, I thought I would record and share my experiences of travel with
          the audience of friends and family through Facebook. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized how
          much I cherish my own home—where I feel comfortable, surrounded by friends, family, and familiar systems.
          There’s freedom in knowing the land, and it’s where I find true happiness.

While I once thought of sharing my experiences with just a small audience back home, I now feel a desire to
          share what makes my home special with a larger audience. I believe others would admire the things that make
          my home unique, just as I would appreciate seeing their experiences in their own homes. In the end, it’s the
          sense of belonging and comfort that makes home truly special, and I’m excited to share that with the world.
