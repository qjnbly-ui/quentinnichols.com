Originally written September 7th, 2024. Revisiting and expanding on these reflections today.

Traveling can really push us out of our comfort zones. Currently in Mississippi, I'm noticing how different
          the atmosphere is from home. Being one of the few white people in many settings makes me feel quite visible,
          and I'm curious about how others navigate similar situations. It's challenging being away from familiar
          comforts, especially with the idea that a vehicle can break down at any moment, but pushing these boundaries
          is a test I'm glad to take.

There's a slight discomfort in being in an environment that’s not the same as home, but I think it’s good to
          experience that. In the end, I want to be more loving, and I know this discomfort is part of the journey. I
          embarked on this trip because I needed to experience these things to let go of reliance on the factors at
          home that can come and go. Instead, I want to rely on God and love, finding truth, meaning, and comfort in all
          situations, no matter where I am.

Reflecting further…

Billy Graham said there is no such thing as an atheist. When someone faces death, they will likely cry out,
          "My God, help me." It’s a reminder of how deeply fear and uncertainty strip away our pretenses. But we don’t
          have to face death to be tested—simply stepping away from our comforts can reveal a lot about who we truly are.

I believe many people, especially those living in cities surrounded by constant comforts, have a false sense
          of security. They hold strong opinions and think themselves strong, but how many of them have truly been
          tested? How many have been alone in the wilderness, with nothing but darkness and their thoughts? Facing
          discomfort and genuine challenge is where we learn what we're made of. It’s not easy, but it’s necessary if
          we’re to understand ourselves fully.

I don’t think most people fully know who they are. Comfort makes it easy to avoid hard truths. If you want to
          be strong, strip away the noise, the conveniences, and the false security. See what you find in yourself when
          everything else is gone. Only then can you truly say you’ve faced yourself—and maybe become stronger for it.
