          I started out watching a documentary about Ed Gein, and it made me think about how someone could ever end up in
          that position. It seems like such a mystery. But the more I sit with it, the more I see how fragile we are in
          these human bodies—how prone we are to external forces we might not even recognize.
        </p>

        <p>
          In “Shifting Perspectives: How Consciousness Shapes Our World and Connections,” I explored how subtle habits and
          unseen forces influence our minds in quiet, almost invisible ways. That reflection now feels like the first step
          in what I'm working through here — how those hidden influences can sometimes push a mind beyond its breaking
          point.
        </p>

        <p>
          Watching Ed Gein’s story stirred memories of my own dad’s struggles. I’ve watched him fall into certain states,
          and for a long time, I had a lot of anger and hatred about it. There were even times I thought the world might
          be better without people who are so far gone. But I’ve come to realize we’re all people. We’re all the same.
          We’re here for a reason, and maybe the point isn’t to sort out who’s “ahead” or “behind,” but to figure out how
          to love one another, rehabilitate one another, and show compassion—even when it’s hard.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve wondered whether schizophrenia or psychosis shows up like a crack in the system of a life — maybe, in Ed
          Gein’s case, after his mother’s control and care disappeared. I imagine she might have at least maintained some
          structure around sleep, food, or habits. When that structure collapsed, perhaps his mind began to fail, and all
          those subconscious things became conscious thoughts. I see a similar thread in addiction too: people who use
          meth or opioids are often blamed for their choices, but sometimes they’re just trying to cope with an unbearable
          state of consciousness. It’s uncomfortable. It’s sickness, not simple weakness. From the outside, we want them
          to see the whole picture, but when you’re in the middle of something that big, you simply can’t.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve even started to wonder if I still believe in the death penalty. My view of the brain has shifted — it feels
          like an antenna for consciousness. There’s good and evil out there, and the way we live and what we put into our
          minds can open or close doors. At a certain point, I think people can become so vulnerable that darker forces
          “play out” through them. Robert Monroe wrote about something like this in his books — how he could enter another
          person’s body, live their memories, act in their life, and then leave, with the person themselves not fully
          remembering. When I read that, it struck me as eerily similar to how mental illness or addiction sometimes
          looks from the outside.
        </p>

        <p>
          All of this has changed the way I see systems like prisons and mental hospitals. Right now, they’re mostly
          failures. There was a time when we had more institutions, but because of poor treatment we got rid of them
          rather than improving them. What we needed wasn’t elimination — it was a complete change of approach. Because
          there are so many people who don’t need to be out in public on their own but do need deep, structured
          rehabilitation. And that rehabilitation has to be built on compassion, not punishment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes, to truly help someone, you have to take their life into your hands with love. You have to pull them
          out of the chaos and put them in a safe, beautiful place. You have to encourage them to sleep, feed them a
          healthy diet, and teach them how their brain operates. You have to remind them that their soul is pure, that the
          body is just an operating vessel, and that the soul is happiest when it’s supported by a balanced life. Other
          forces can “hop in” and take control without someone’s knowledge, leaving them to deal with the aftermath. But
          given the right environment, many can heal — or at least be cared for with dignity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking across all of history and traditions, across every religion and culture, people have always wrestled
          with the meaning of consciousness, good and evil, love and hatred. We’ve seen how fragile the mind can be, how
          easily it can break, and yet how much potential for beauty there is in healing. We need to learn from that. We
          need to stop seeing people as monsters beyond hope and start seeing them as children of God — no matter how aged
          or broken they appear, still children at their core.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is something I’ve been wrestling with through my own personal life. I think ultimate love and compassion —
          what Jesus and so much of the Bible teaches — is really onto something. The best way to go about anything is in
          love. It’s something I don’t always want to admit, because I still have hatred and anger for evil. But I’m
          starting to see that love can truly overpower evil. And honestly, it’s almost hard to accept. It’s something I
          don’t want to accept — but deep down, I think it’s true.
