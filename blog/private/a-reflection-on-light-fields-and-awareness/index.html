        <p>
          I’m going to share with you a series of my thoughts — things that I think while in the shower — and this is how
          it played out.
        </p>

        <p>
          I removed my 14-karat white gold necklace with its cross pendant this morning in the shower. The last time I’d
          taken it off was at the Biltmore Estate in North Carolina about a year ago, and since then I’ve simply showered
          with it, worn it through work, through life. But this morning I set it aside, looked at it, and the meaning of
          the cross blended with the physicality of the metal in a new way.
        </p>

        <p>
          I thought about the necklace’s symbol and meaning — why I decided to wear it — and I’d eventually like to think
          that through and write it all out in a story of its own.
        </p>

        <p>
          But then I thought about the chain itself: gold, a conductor.
        </p>

        <p>
          I asked myself: could something like this, resting on my body every day, actually interfere with the brain’s
          electrical activity?
        </p>

        <p>
          Almost like wrapping a metal wire around a microwave — would it change the field at all?
        </p>

        <p>
          (A microwave oven generates electromagnetic waves through a magnetron transformer — essentially a series of
          coiled wires that convert electrical energy into high-frequency radiation. Adding another coil or conductor
          nearby can, in principle, alter the magnetic field’s distribution — so my thought was: could my necklace,
          another “coil,” slightly interfere with the electromagnetic field of the brain in the same way?)
        </p>

        <p>
          I did some research. I found that gold, while an excellent conductor, is not strong enough nor sufficiently
          coupled to the brain to alter how neurons fire in any meaningful way. (Neurons communicate through tiny
          electrical pulses measured in microvolts — millionths of a volt — shielded by bone and tissue, meaning an
          external metal object doesn’t significantly change their activity.) The electrical fields produced by neurons
          are so subtle — microvolts of energy, embedded within tissue, shielded by skull and scalp. What a metal
          necklace might do is slightly affect how we measure those signals (for example, in an EEG), but it does not
          change the fundamental firing of the brain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, this led me to consider the broader picture — the body’s electromagnetic field, the rhythms of the
          brain and the heart.
        </p>

        <p>
          The heart produces the strongest electromagnetic field of any organ — measurable several feet away. (This is
          why an electrocardiogram, or ECG, can easily detect its field even at a distance from the chest — it generates
          about sixty times more amplitude than the brain’s field.)
        </p>

        <p>
          The brain’s field is far weaker, but still real, detectable with instruments like MEG and EEG. (A
          magnetoencephalogram, or MEG, measures the magnetic field produced by the brain’s electrical currents, though
          the signal is a billion times weaker than Earth’s magnetic field.)
        </p>

        <p>
          And yet, those measurements involve electrodes or sensors that touch the body or detect external fields. They
          don’t capture the entire phenomenon — just an interface. (The deeper complexity — what’s happening inside
          consciousness itself — remains beyond those readings, hinting that what’s “measured” is only one layer of the
          real event.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Then I thought of the work of the Monroe Institute and their Hemi-Sync technology — sound patterns designed to
          entrain brainwave activity. (Hemi-Sync uses two slightly different audio frequencies, one in each ear, to create
          a perceived “binaural beat.” The brain then synchronizes to the difference between those frequencies, subtly
          shifting its dominant wave pattern — from alert beta states to relaxed alpha or meditative theta.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Does the tone actually change how neurons fire, or simply adjust the frequency of their firing? It feels like
          aligning the timing belt in a piston engine — everything is already there, moving, alive. The entrainment
          doesn’t create new neurons; it modulates the rhythm of the existing ones. (In technical terms, it’s not forcing
          the neurons to behave differently, but coaxing large groups of them to oscillate together — what neuroscientists
          call “phase coherence.”)
        </p>

        <p>
          “I started thinking about light in a way that… like, say right now, as I’m writing this, I’m looking out the
          window, and I see a willow tree with a leaf that has a yellow hue to it. Some way or another, that yellow leaf
          has energy to it. What’s quite crazy is the energy’s coming from the sun, it’s hitting that willow tree, and
          then it’s reflecting what that willow tree is made up of that comes back as an energy wave to my retina, which
          is then translated into the neurological function of the brain to where I’m able to see that. And then what’s
          crazy is this whole field of view that the human eyes have is a bunch of lines of energy coming in, and the
          retina’s able to translate every single one of those lines of energy into an electrical signal that our brains
          turn into an image. The brain being able to perform that function alone is incredible. That all happens, and we
          have a vision. That’s the first time I saw it in that way, and it was like a light bulb went off in my head.
          And then I realised that ‘light bulb,’ that reference of a light bulb we all use, is literally neurons firing
          in the brain, making that connection, which you observe as feeling like a light bulb — a new idea — is the
          first time that pathway’s ever been used. So that connection is literally an electrical connection that was
          established in the brain and used for the first time. So that’s why it feels like a light bulb goes off. Isn’t
          that incredible?”
        </p>

        <p>
          (Physically speaking, the yellow hue you perceive is the specific wavelength of light — around 580 nanometers
          — that the leaf’s surface reflects. Photons from the sun bounce off the leaf, strike the retina’s photoreceptors,
          and are converted into electrical impulses. The brain’s visual cortex then interprets millions of these signals
          every second, integrating them into a unified, continuous image. So yes — there truly are countless beams of
          reflected energy creating what appears to us as one solid, stable picture. The “light bulb” you felt go off is a
          real neuro-electrical event — a fresh network of neurons firing together for the first time.)
        </p>

        <p>
          That realization tied everything together — the cross, the conductor, the heart field, the brain field, and the
          light itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          A chain of energy and meaning, running through metal, flesh, and awareness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe that’s what faith really is — the weirdness of connections.
