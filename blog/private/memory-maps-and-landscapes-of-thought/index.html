          I’ve always felt that memories and locations are deeply intertwined. When I first went to New Zealand, I made
          it a habit to listen to podcasts daily, much like I do today. This routine marked the beginning of a unique
          way of reflecting: I found that whenever I returned to familiar paddocks while driving a tractor, past
          thoughts and entire podcast episodes would play back in my mind, tied to the places where those memories first
          took root.
        </p>

        <p>
          After my time in New Zealand, I began working for Trees LLC, trimming trees across Klamath and Lake County in
          Oregon. As I reflect on these experiences, I realize that the vast landscapes have become a living memory
          bank. Each mountain, road, and even individual tree is a marker of the thoughts I had while working there
          years ago. Driving through Tulelake today brought it all flooding back. It struck me how amazing it is that
          these memories and thoughts are etched into the land itself, waiting to be revisited.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to work across such a wide range of places. It makes me wonder:
          how much smaller would my mental map be if I had only stayed in Bly? How many layers of memory can be tied to
          just one place? It’s not only the memories of what I did but the thoughts I had while doing them that make
          these connections so valuable.
        </p>

        <p>
          This realization adds a deep sense of meaning to travel. It’s why sitting in beautiful scenery can feel so
          fulfilling—it’s not just the view but the memories and reflections that come alive in those moments.
