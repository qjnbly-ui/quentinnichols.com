          As I’ve come to understand Jesus more, I’ve started to think about how His life must have felt. He lived with
          a level of divine understanding and connection that most people couldn’t grasp, and I imagine that, over time,
          this set Him apart in a profound way. Not because He wanted to separate Himself, but because He had to live and
          preach in a way that aligned fully with the divine nature He embodied. He wasn’t just teaching people how to
          live; He was showing them what it meant to be in complete unity with God, something most of us only glimpse in
          moments of clarity.
