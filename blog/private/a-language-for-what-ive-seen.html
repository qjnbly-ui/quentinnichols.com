          There’s something about finally finding words for things you’ve always felt.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about Paul—the one from scripture. I don’t know everything about what happened
          to him, but there was this moment on the road to Damascus, when he was going to persecute Christians, and
          something changed in him. Completely. Whatever it was—vision, voice, experience—it shook him. And I can’t help
          but wonder what really happened there.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think he encountered something so powerful, it stripped away who he thought he was. It might’ve been
          terrifying. Whether it was through his own mind, or some kind of divine or altered-state encounter, I don’t
          know. But I’ve had enough experiences to believe it’s possible to see something that breaks your identity
          apart. Something that shows you the truth—but doesn’t always come with instructions.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s where Paul differs from Jesus to me. I think Jesus understood the truth completely. He saw how things
          worked behind the veil. But instead of laying it out plainly, he used parables. And now I get why. He wasn’t
          trying to be mysterious—he was trying not to break people with truth they weren’t ready for. That’s what a
          parable is: a safe container for something too big to say directly.
        </p>

        <p>
          But Paul… Paul tried to turn it into a system. I respect what he did, and I get why. But I think he changed the
          direction of Jesus’ message. Jesus spoke in symbols and silence. Paul built structure and theology. And that
          structure became Christianity as we know it.
        </p>

        <p>
          What really got me thinking deeper about all this was a growing sense that history isn’t far away—it’s close. I
          had spent a lot of time reading about people like Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and Andrew Jackson. I
          studied their lives, their movements, their decisions. And then I found myself, without planning it, actually
          traveling across the country and standing in the places where they once stood. I visited Andrew Jackson’s home
          —the Hermitage—and it felt like everything I had studied suddenly became real. Tangible. The distance between
          their time and mine collapsed.
        </p>

        <p>
          I used to think of the 1700s and 1800s as impossibly far away. But the more I walked those grounds, the more I
          understood: it’s just a couple generations back. And when I later moved through Louisiana, I kept thinking
          about what it must’ve been like when these men were forging their path forward—laying logs across swampland to
          build roads toward places like St. Louis. It’s humbling to realize how much of our life today is built on their
          efforts. Being there, feeling the weight of it—it felt present. Not past.
        </p>

        <p>
          And yet, for a while before all of that, I had been spending so much time studying Jesus and the history around
          him—roughly between 200 BC and 500 AD—that I actually felt closer to that time period than I did to the 1700s.
          Spiritually, it felt familiar. Like I had almost lived there. I could imagine what it felt like. The more I
          read and learned about it, the more real it became.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started to feel like if I really want to understand my life, I have to learn about the lives of others.
          Especially those who were awake to something deeper. I believe that just getting a glimpse of another person’s
          experience can shape you forever. It adds to your character. You become the average of all these moments, these
          lives, these truths. If I want to walk like Jesus, I should learn what Jesus said. If I want to understand the
          foundations of this country, I need to walk the land where it was formed, to stand where Franklin or Jackson
          once stood. It’s more than history—it’s proximity to meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
          And then something else has been unfolding too. Not just through travel or study, but in quiet moments. When I
          meditate. When I close my eyes. I think sometimes, in stillness, we don’t just reflect on our own experiences—we
          tap into something broader. There are times when I sit and watch scenes play out behind my eyes. I can learn
          things I’ve never lived, see places I’ve never been, feel moments that aren’t mine. It’s like something deeper
          within me is showing me something, and I’ve never had the language to explain it. Until today.
        </p>

        <p>
          This morning, I spent the first few hours really trying to understand what I’ve been experiencing. I wanted to
          find language for experiences that most people never even try to describe. I want to be able to do that—to give
          voice to what so many of us have felt but haven’t known how to say. And what I found today was a kind of
          framework, a triangle that helped shape these thoughts:
        </p>

        <p>
          Witness Consciousness – when you realize you’re not your thoughts, you’re the one watching them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mental Theatre – those vivid, dreamlike scenes that can unfold inside your mind, even while you’re fully awake.
        </p>

        <p>
          Default Mode Network (DMN) – a network in the brain that creates your sense of self, timeline, and personal
          identity. It’s the part that quiets down during deep meditation or moments of spiritual clarity—and sometimes,
          in those moments, you glimpse something beyond your normal story.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don’t fully know what happens when the eyes are closed and the mind is open. But I know there’s something
          there. Something powerful. People like Nikola Tesla used to describe closing his eyes and being able to see
          machines in perfect detail. That’s something I’ve thought about a lot. It seems to prove that we hold more
          inside than we realize. And that by stilling the body, we can unlock something vast.
        </p>

        <p>
          There’s something incredible that exists spiritually within us. And I strive every day to learn about it. Not
          just through scripture, but through lives—spiritual figures, writers, mystics, even philosophers. What amazes
          me is how often their insights align. Across cultures, across time, there’s this shared understanding of
          something more. And now, piece by piece, I feel like I’m beginning to touch it.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the same time, I know how overwhelming these experiences can be. Today reminded me that this kind of
          awakening is something well documented. Zen traditions speak of spiritual emergencies. Yoga traditions warn of
          kundalini crisis. Even Christian mystics have written about people who lost themselves in visions without
          discernment. And I think about Paul again—how I never want to experience something that makes me lose myself
          like that. I don’t want to be broken open too fast, too far. I want to stay grounded. Curious. Open to
          something bigger than myself, but rooted in a life I can still live.
        </p>

        <p>
          This post—it’s a marker. A step along that road. A way to remember what’s unfolding, what I’m learning, and the
          quiet, steady joy of finding just enough language to hold the experience without breaking it.
