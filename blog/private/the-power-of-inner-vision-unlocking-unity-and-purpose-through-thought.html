          Remember, all knowledge originates within the human mind. Learning is the exciting opportunity we have to hear
          someone else's thoughts and explore how we can reach the same conclusion or arrive at a different
          understanding. Perhaps we’ve already seen this in our minds at some point.
        </p>

        <p>
          View your thoughts within your mind like scenery during a drive. Thoughts pass by the same way—don’t think
          they are meaningless, like the same scene passing over and over. Instead, open your inner eyes, watch them,
          give them the meaning they hold. Get deep in thought, meditate, and the colors become more vivid. See your
          thoughts, explore them, and realize that some of the greatest minds, like Nikola Tesla, didn’t just “come up
          with” a thought; he meditated and SAW his inventions!
        </p>

        <p>
          You might wonder: is this possible? Is this within my capacity? YES! Have you ever dreamt before? Of course—
          and you saw those dreams as if they were real, right? YES! In those moments, your brain was operating in a
          very low frequency, where consciousness mostly seems not to exist.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a deep feeling we become conscious in a different realm—a deeper spiritual side of our souls during
          this time—but that is another level. Let’s get back on track. Not far above this frequency (or, for some,
          perhaps within it), we start to become “conscious” while deep in thought, like in a meditative state. Here,
          we can explore and “see” our thoughts. Although it’s difficult to find this place, it exists.
        </p>

        <p>
          I truly believe these states have a divine purpose. I think it is nearly impossible for evil to reside
          here—but that differs from fear; don’t forget that! Here, I might add, I think evil and pain exist on the
          opposite side of the brain’s frequency spectrum.
        </p>

        <p>
          My point is, I deeply feel that so many of us—potentially all—are at fault for not seeing this within
          ourselves. We follow the lead of others instead of listening to the voice within. Once you recognize this, as
          I have, the world becomes so much clearer. There is an answer to every question, and love is abundant. I
          encourage us all to work on this.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this space, we can find unity, not the shame of a divided people we are becoming.
        </p>
