        <p>
          Lately, I’ve been drawn to a bunch of different things—Ky Dickens on the Joe Rogan Experience, The Telepathy
          Tapes, books by Robert Monroe—and the more I take in, the more everything just starts connecting. All of it.
          Every interest I’ve had recently overlaps with something else I already knew deep down. And it’s not just
          interesting—it’s overwhelming in the best way. Like some bigger truth is starting to take shape.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve never been to the “hill” like some of the kids talk about in those telepathy episodes. I don’t know that
          place. But I’ve been to a place. A place where it felt like everything was floating around me—information,
          feelings, knowing—but I didn’t exactly understand it. I couldn’t label it all or bring it back with me. I just
          spent hours there. And it felt like I was barely scratching the surface. I organized a few pieces, made some
          sense of parts of it… but mostly, I just knew that it was real. That it’s always there, waiting. And that one
          day, I’ll be able to spend more time there and make more sense of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          But that place—that realm, or state, or whatever it is—it’s what showed me how valuable daily life really is.
          Here, in this body, in this moment, we get to live. We get to experience all of this from a minimal, material
          point of view. And that’s a gift. That other place isn’t going anywhere. It’ll be there again. Maybe when I
          sleep, maybe when I pass on. But this—this human life—is where I get to feel the sun on my face, play music,
          laugh with friends, eat something good, and see beauty in the small stuff.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most nights, I go to bed with this feeling like I didn’t quite get it all down. Like I lived something
          beautiful—had thoughts I’ve never had before, saw something in a new light—but didn’t stop to write any of it.
          I didn’t fully capture it. And I think that’s what leaves me a little unsettled at the end of the day. It’s not
          regret—it’s more like I missed a chance to honor it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don’t feel pressure to write things perfectly, but I do feel a pull to document this part of my life. Because
          it’s happening fast. I’m changing quickly. And I know someday, I’ll want to look back and see how it all came
          together. I want other people to be able to look at it too—not just the result, but the process. The raw, honest
          parts. The parts where I was still figuring things out, still asking questions, still finding the words.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s what excites me so much about The Telepathy Tapes. Hearing what these kids are going through—what they’re
          able to access and describe—it gives a kind of credit to the experiences I’ve felt myself. Not the same, of
          course. What they’re experiencing is uniquely their own, tied to their physiology, their brain, their way of
          being. But it resonates. It confirms that there is something real about these deeper states of awareness, these
          layers of consciousness that not everyone sees. And that makes me want to learn more—not just about them, but
          about everyone. About what people feel, what they go through, and how their minds and bodies process this life.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the same time, it pushes me to go inward. To practice more meditation. To be more present. To try and meet
          that state—not by force or imitation, but by tuning into what I’ve already been shown. I may not have been born
          with the same access they have, but I’ve had glimpses. And I know there’s more waiting if I’m willing to sit
          with it.
        </p>

        <p>
          This also ties back to something I’ve written about before—both in my blog post on Jeffrey Long’s books about
          near-death experiences, and another post where I shared what Jesus said: “The kingdom of God is within you”
          (Luke 17:21), and also, “Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and
          they will do even greater things than these…” (John 14:12). I really believe this is what he was talking about.
          That there’s something more living in all of us—something we’ve forgotten how to see. Jesus saw it. He lived it.
          And I think he recognized that most people weren’t living with that same awareness, and he hoped we would.
          Because life with that kind of connection is different. It’s clearer. It’s fuller.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that same message shows up again in near-death experiences. The people who go through those moments come
          back changed—not just because of where they went, but because they felt what was already inside them. It
          confirms what I’ve come to believe: there is something deeper living within us, and we don’t have to wait until
          death to know it. We can live inside it right now.
        </p>

        <p>
          There’s so much confirmation I’ve read about that tells us this place is real. For example, I recently read
          Nikola Tesla’s autobiography, My Inventions, and in it he talked thoroughly about practicing and training his
          mind to enter this space. It was a place where he would “see” his intentions—design and test them all from
          within. He spent so much of his time with his eyes closed, in a place so much greater than what we can see with
          our eyes open. That really hit me. The more I read things like that, the more I see how vast this hidden world
          is inside us.
        </p>

        <p>
          It makes so much sense that the people who dedicate time to write, or to create, clearly have something bigger
          inside them—something they feel called to share. The more we open our own neural networks and allow ourselves
          to see that, the more we’re able to go off on our own journeys within.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that’s part of what makes me feel so deeply for people. Sometimes, even if I haven’t lived their exact
          experience, I feel like I know where they are. I’ve studied the brain a lot—different levels of consciousness,
          brainwave frequencies, neurotransmitters, anatomy, all of it. That knowledge helped me build a kind of
          visual—a working map of how the brain and consciousness operate. But once that template was there, I didn’t
          just see it as information anymore. I could move through it. I could feel it.
        </p>

        <p>
          So now, when I think about someone like my dad, who’s experienced psychosis, I feel like I’m not just imagining
          what he’s gone through—I’m actually playing through the neural network of his mind. I see it in my head. I feel
          it as if I’ve been there, even if I haven’t fully crossed that line. I’ve had moments—like staying up too long,
          pushing my mind too far—where I was close. And I knew that if I had kept going, I would’ve fallen into the same
          space. But I didn’t. I stayed right at the edge. And somehow, that gave me insight.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s not something I learned from books. It’s spiritual. It’s intuitive. I’ve tried to explain this to my
          brother and sister before—that I just know who he is. Not through study, but through something deeper. It’s like
          the neural map I carry lets me walk through someone else’s experience, not to diagnose it or label it, but to
          feel it. That kind of knowing isn’t easy to explain—but it’s real. And it’s shaped how I see the world, how I
          care for others, and why I write any of this in the first place.
        </p>

        <p>
          And sometimes I think that’s why art and music matter so much. It’s something I’ve written about before, and
          honestly, I wish I spent more time there—more time playing guitar, piano, creating music, just being in that
          space. Because the arts of this world, they come from a loving place. They’ve always been expressions of
          something deeper. Joe Rogan mentioned it on one of his recent episodes, and you can hear it in so many
          voices—biblical text, near-death experiences, the stories of people across time. That kind of love gets
          expressed through music, painting, rhythm, beauty.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes I think, instead of trying to write a book or prove all these thoughts through science and
          explanation, maybe the simplest and most powerful thing I can do is just create. Because music literally
          changes brainwaves. It shifts people into different states of consciousness. It’s one of the few things that
          can reach people without explanation—just feeling. Through words and music, I can share what I’ve experienced.
          And in that moment, they can feel it too.
        </p>

        <p>
          And I’ve also come to believe that sleep might be more than just a personal reset. It feels like everything we
          experience in a day—our thoughts, emotions, memories—gets uploaded somewhere greater. Like we’re returning it to
          a collective consciousness. Releasing it from just our individual experience and passing it into something that
          belongs to all of us. And the next morning, we start new. But if we needed to, I think we could still access
          what others have seen, what they’ve felt, what they’ve left behind in that field. That idea… it makes life feel
          even more connected. Like we’re not learning alone—we’re learning together, even in silence.
        </p>

        <p>
          And at the end of all this, there’s a quote I’ve carried with me for over a year now. It’s been at the top of
          my website, and if you’ve read anything I’ve written before, you might’ve seen it. But if you haven’t heard
          it—or even if you have—I want to share it again, because everything I’ve said here really comes from this:
        </p>

        <p>
          “We are born with the gift of not knowing, to delight in learning life’s simple joys. Our bodies bear the price
          of adventure, and sleep our return to essence.”
        </p>

        <p>
          What’s crazy is—I actually wrote that quote myself. Over a year ago. I had just come out of a deep meditation
          when the words came to me, and I remember feeling like they didn’t just come from me—they came through me. And
          what’s stuck with me is that it keeps meaning more. Like it said something I didn’t even fully understand yet.
          As if it was planted in me as a reminder… for now, and for everything still to come.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s the message. We’re not born with all the answers, and that’s the gift. We get to learn, explore, and
          feel. We get to be surprised by beauty and find joy in the simplest things. And our bodies—they’re part of that
          process. They grow tired. They carry the weight of everything we go through, the physical side of adventure.
          Without that, we’d never slow down. We’d never reflect. We’d never pause long enough to find meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that’s why sleep matters. It’s our return to essence. The place where we offload the day’s experience, give
          it back to the whole, and reset. Each new day becomes another chance to start again. Another moment to live,
          learn, and feel the depth of being alive.
        </p>

        <p>
          That quote has stayed with me because it holds so much truth in so few words. And it’s where all of this comes
          from. If anything in this post spoke to you, just know—it’s already in you too.
