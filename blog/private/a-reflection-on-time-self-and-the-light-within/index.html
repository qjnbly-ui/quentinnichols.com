          I’m 24 years old. Boy, did I think I was on a good track when I was 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and even 23.
          And in many ways, I was. This morning, I was thinking about how my interpretation of the story of David and
          Goliath has shifted over the years, and how each of those years—every version of me—has played an important role
          in getting here.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s clear to me now: time is insignificant. I feel like my 16-year-old self is still with me—sometimes
          offering better thoughts than I have now. Other times, I guide him with what I’ve learned. I hop back and forth
          between those versions of me, knowing they always exist within me, but at the core, I’m my modern self—with the
          insight of the past and a deep connection to the future. And it’s a bright future. I feel that in my bones. It's
          not even a belief I created, but more like something that’s always existed inside me. Maybe inside all of us.
        </p>

        <p>
          There’s no rush. I’m not chasing anything. I’ve started to realize that success is inevitable. I can say that
          with confidence because of the life I’ve lived so far. Sure, I’m behind on a lot, and I should probably stress
          about some of it—but I don’t. There’s peace in knowing the future is good. That this time right now is to be
          walked through slowly, with great memories, good health, and low stress. I imagine myself looking back on this
          time with clarity and gratitude—no matter what form that reflection takes.
        </p>

        <p>
          I can’t explain my faith or what I think of as God in any perfect terms. But I know it’s something within.
          Something deep. Just like our brains express a unique form of consciousness, I believe we each embody God
          itself—with the potential to bring all the good in the world into fruition. It’s not just about me being unique.
          Even if I wasn’t here, consciousness would still exist in the same way. The body might carry a unique code, but
          that code doesn’t come alive until the light of awareness sparks each morning.
        </p>

        <p>
          In that way, we’re all connected. All of us are the light of consciousness, with different ways of expressing
          it, and that’s what makes it so exciting. I think that’s why I’m so drawn to people like Joe Rogan or others out
          there truly living—earning an income simply by sharing their experiences, their thoughts, and their truth. It’s
          one of the most exciting times to be alive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually, I’ll find my place in that same rhythm. I’ll be one of the many just living life—freely, fully,
          honestly.
