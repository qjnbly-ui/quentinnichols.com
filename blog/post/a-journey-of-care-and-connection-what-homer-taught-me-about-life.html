        <p>
          I want to take a moment to express just how much I love and care for each of you. Over the past 15 months,
          I have had the incredible opportunity to step into Homer Green's life and care for him. It has been about
          six months now living with him, and during this time, I have come to a profound understanding that there is
          a God who loves us all deeply. This life on earth is not meant to be perfect; it is in heaven where we will
          find a perfect existence with God. But what is that existence without understanding how beautiful it truly
          is?
        </p>

        <p>
          Knowledge, to me, is an adventurous gift we have access to. In heaven, everything will be whole with God,
          but here on earth, we have the opportunity to learn, grow, and build our character. The hard times are part
          of this journey. God gave us bodies that bear the cost of the adventures we seek, reminding us not to stray
          too far from Him. Even sleep feels like a reminder of God's love, offering us a chance to return to Him and
          start new each day, well-rested. There is an overwhelming beauty in all of this.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though it has been tough, I know there is a purpose to my role in Homer's life and, more importantly, all
          that God has taught me through this experience. These last six months have brought me closer to God than I
          have ever been without physically being in heaven. Life is so beautiful, and I am incredibly thankful for
          all the opportunities I have been given.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have been wanting to share this for a while now. I am so grateful for all of you and the love you bring
          into my life. I know I have been distant and have gone through hard times. I have taken the last three months
          off work and have not been as present in others' lives as I once was, fully dedicating myself to Homer, who
          has given me so much. Now, as we near the end of this journey, with Homer's time coming, I want to thank you
          all for your support and understanding. I do not know when God will take Homer with Him, but we are both
          ready. Homer has become a godly, loving man, and I am at peace with whatever comes next.

        <h2>Following Homer's Death</h2>

        <p>
          Since Homer's death, I have taken time to reflect on the profound impact he had on my life. The experience
          of caring for him, especially in his final days, has brought me to a deeper understanding of love, life, and
          faith. His passing, as peaceful as it was, marked the end of a significant chapter in my life, one filled
          with growth, challenges, and spiritual transformation.
        </p>

        <p>
          I will forever cherish the lessons I learned during this time. Homer's transformation in his final days,
          where he showed a newfound care and love for those around him, was a beautiful thing to witness. It was a
          reminder of the capacity for change and the power of love, even in the most difficult moments.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I move forward, I find myself filled with a sense of gratitude and optimism for the future. The journey
          with Homer has taught me so much about myself and the world around me. Though finding my new place in life
          will take time, I am confident that the experiences and lessons from this period will guide me toward a path
          filled with purpose and fulfillment.

        <h2 id="post-video-title">A Short Tribute To Homer</h2>
        <p>
          A few weeks prior to Homers death, we created a short video with his voice singing "Save Me" by Jelly Roll.
          This video includes photos and videos through a wide time frame prior to his fall that led him to the care of
          hospice and myself. He quit drinking and fully changed during my 15 months being with him everyday.
