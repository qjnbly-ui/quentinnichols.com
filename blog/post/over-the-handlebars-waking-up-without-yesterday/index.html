        <p>
          On February 12th, 2016, a Friday after school, a friend and I rode our bikes around town and watched a really
          good sunset. It was one of those simple, forgettable-in-the-moment days that only feels important in hindsight.
        </p>

        <p>
          The next morning, February 13th, we were heading to my mom’s house to get ready for the day. We decided to race
          our bikes down the dirt road toward her place. It wasn’t far. At some point during the ride, my sweatshirt got
          caught in my front tire. I flew over the handlebars and hit my face on the gravel.
        </p>

        <p>
          My memory of the accident itself is fragmented. I remember waking up that morning, heading out towards my mom’s
          and asking Anthony if he wanted to race. For a long time, I didn’t remember anything after that. As time passed,
          some pieces came back. I now remember taking my sweatshirt off and placing it near the handlebars. I remember
          seeing blood running down my face and feeling a headache, knowing something wasn’t right. I asked Anthony to
          help me to my mom’s house, hoping my stepdad Kyle was home.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most of what happened next was filled in over the following month by other people. The next clear memory I have
          is being in the hospital. Kyle was standing next to me, comforting me. Everything felt dreamlike, but my head
          hurt badly. I remember bits of my mom being on the phone, panicked, trying to get to the hospital in Klamath
          Falls from Bend, where she had been at my younger sister’s sports game.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I later learned that Kyle called my grandma Marla to come help. They decided to drive me to the hospital rather
          than wait for an ambulance, since that was quicker for our remote area in Bly and my grandma has the medical
          experience to provide the same level of care I would have received on the ambulance. My grandpa drove while
          Grandma cared for me. I still don’t remember any of this.
        </p>

        <p>
          When my mom arrived, I asked where my girlfriend Jesse was. She told me that we had recently broken up. That
          didn’t make sense to me at all. My memory told me something different, and I couldn’t reconcile the two.
        </p>

        <p>
          After that, my memory fades again until I woke up at my grandma Marla’s house with a pounding headache. She
          told me some friends wanted to talk to me. She handed me the phone. I could hear voices, but I didn’t recognize
          them. They told me they were thinking of me. I asked the main speaker what his name was. He said Eddy. I told
          him I was sorry, but I didn’t know who he was. I felt terrible saying that. Again, it all felt like a dream. I
          knew I had been hurt and that I had a concussion, but not much beyond that.
        </p>

        <p>
          One detail I later remembered from the hospital stood out. Doctors questioned whether my injuries really came
          from a bike accident. At the time, it felt unsettling, but I now understand that it was standard procedure to
          make sure kids are safe at home.
        </p>

        <p>
          The recovery was long. I couldn’t shower normally for a while, and my hair became greasy. My ear was badly
          injured, nearly torn apart, and took a long time to heal. My mom had to clean it, bandage it, and apply
          ointment for quite some time. Eventually, I went to the orthodontist, who told me that if I hadn’t already had
          braces, I likely would have lost most of my front teeth, both top and bottom. Because of the accident, I had
          to wear braces for an additional six months. My braces would often catch on my injured lips, causing constant
          discomfort.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I began to recover, I realized I had lost about two months of memory from before the accident. It took
          roughly six weeks of looking through photos and listening to stories from friends to piece things back
          together. I wasn’t allowed to play sports until I could pass a cognitive test. I tried multiple times before I
          finally did.
        </p>

        <p>
          During that time, my math teacher, Richard Otto, was a huge supporter of me. He told me that after the
          concussion, I wasn’t the same in class. I had become quieter and more reserved. I didn’t notice the change
          myself, but I trust that he saw something real.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, more memories returned. I eventually remembered Anthony holding me up as we walked to my mom’s front
          door and waiting for Kyle to help. I don’t remember much after that. I think I had just enough awareness to
          know I needed help, and then I shut down.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was a serious experience, one I’m fortunate to have recovered from. In a strange way, I’m grateful for it.
          It gave me insight into how disorienting and frightening head injuries can be, and it’s helped me show more
          patience and understanding toward others who go through similar situations now that I work as an EMT in Bly.
        </p>

            It&#39;s days like today that remind me how blessed we are. I know that we have amazing family and friends.
            Quentin&#39;s most serious injury is a concussion. He has a lot of scrapes, cuts and bruising but that will
            heal. And some very sore and loose teeth but I imagine if he didn&#39;t have braces on he would be missing a
            few so the braces are probably a blessing although he probably doesn&#39;t think so now. And these injuries
            were from a bicycle accident probably 100 ft. from his front door. Thanks for all the thoughts and prayers.

            I love you Quentin. Not fun being over 2 hours away when your kid gets hurt. Thankful for both of your
            grandmas and the rest of the family for taking care of you while i drove home.
