          Knowledge is abundant and, for me, one of the most enjoyable ways to shape our understanding of the world
          and our character. The books listed below have had a profound impact on how I think and perceive life -
          some to a great extent, while others sparked a deeper curiosity. I want my followers to understand who I am,
          not just through my personal experiences (which you can read about elsewhere on the site), but also through
          the ideas and lessons I have gathered from the experiences of others.
        </p>
        <p class="reads-body">
          I have come to realize that almost everything we go through in life has been lived by someone before us.
          Books offer a shortcut to gaining those insights. By sharing this collection, I hope to provide a window
          into how these works have influenced me and invite you to explore them too.
